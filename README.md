# Hi, I'm [Mike Crute](https://mike.crute.us)!

I'm a software engineer at a large tech company,
though I don't represent my employer here, and a
hacker of open-source software. I'm an [Alpine
Linux](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/mcrute) developer and
[package maintainer](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?maintainer=Mike+Crute)
as well as one of the lead contributors on the
[Alpine Linux Cloud](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/cloud) team.

I [self-host my code](https://code.crute.us). What you will find here
is a tiny subset of my work. There are a few write-only mirrors, some
collaborations, and a bunch of archives of old but possibly interesting
projects. My pinned projects are actively maintained.
